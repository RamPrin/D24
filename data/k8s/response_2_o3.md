Below is a list of identified threats against the Kubernetes model you provided, organized by STRIDE category. Each threat has a short title, a one‑line description, and DREAD scoring (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability; each 1–5, with a total).

1. Spoofing
- Spoof API Server Client  
  Description: Attacker impersonates a legitimate kube‑admin or service account to call the API.  
  DREAD: D=4, R=3, E=3, A=4, Di=3 → Total=17

- Spoof etcd Client  
  Description: Attacker fakes etcd client credentials to read/write cluster state.  
  DREAD: D=4, R=2, E=3, A=5, Di=2 → Total=16

- Spoof Kubelet  
  Description: Malicious actor pretends to be a kubelet to receive pod specs or kube‑admin commands.  
  DREAD: D=3, R=2, E=3, A=4, Di=3 → Total=15

- Spoof Container Runtime API  
  Description: Fake container‑runtime endpoint to inject or control containers.  
  DREAD: D=3, R=2, E=4, A=3, Di=3 → Total=15

2. Tampering
- Tamper API Requests  
  Description: Modify in‑transit API calls (e.g. change pod specs, CRD definitions).  
  DREAD: D=4, R=3, E=3, A=5, Di=3 → Total=18

- Tamper etcd Data at Rest  
  Description: Directly alter stored Deployment Config, ConfigMap, Secret or app state in etcd.  
  DREAD: D=5, R=2, E=2, A=5, Di=2 → Total=16

- Tamper Service Networking Rules  
  Description: Change iptables rules via compromised kube‑proxy to redirect or block traffic.  
  DREAD: D=3, R=2, E=3, A=4, Di=3 → Total=15

- Tamper Container Images  
  Description: Alter container images in the registry or on disk to include backdoors.  
  DREAD: D=5, R=4, E=4, A=5, Di=3 → Total=21

3. Repudiation
- Insufficient Logging on API Server  
  Description: Lack of detailed audit/logs prevents tracing who performed actions.  
  DREAD: D=2, R=4, E=5, A=3, Di=4 → Total=18

- Insufficient Audit in etcd  
  Description: No or weak write‑auditing in etcd makes state changes non‑attributable.  
  DREAD: D=2, R=4, E=5, A=4, Di=4 → Total=19

- Missing Logs on Container Runtime  
  Description: Container runtime interactions (image pulls, exec) aren’t logged centrally.  
  DREAD: D=2, R=4, E=5, A=3, Di=4 → Total=18

4. Information Disclosure
- Expose Secrets in etcd  
  Description: Attacker gains access to unencrypted or poorly encrypted etcd snapshots containing Secrets.  
  DREAD: D=5, R=2, E=3, A=5, Di=3 → Total=18

- Intercept API Calls (MITM)  
  Description: Man‑in‑the‑middle on HTTPS API channel to read ConfigMap/Secret payloads.  
  DREAD: D=4, R=3, E=3, A=5, Di=3 → Total=18

- Leak App Data via CSI  
  Description: Compromised CSI plugin exposes application PV data to unauthorized users.  
  DREAD: D=3, R=2, E=3, A=4, Di=3 → Total=15

5. Denial of Service
- DoS API Server  
  Description: Flood Kubernetes API with requests to degrade or shut down control plane.  
  DREAD: D=4, R=5, E=2, A=5, Di=4 → Total=20

- DoS etcd  
  Description: Overload etcd with read/write operations, causing control‑plane instability.  
  DREAD: D=4, R=5, E=2, A=5, Di=4 → Total=20

- Resource Exhaustion on Worker Nodes  
  Description: Launch many pods or heavy workloads to starve CPU/memory on nodes.  
  DREAD: D=4, R=5, E=3, A=5, Di=4 → Total=21

- Network DoS on Kube‑Proxy  
  Description: Overwhelm service‑networking rules or flood iptables to block legitimate traffic.  
  DREAD: D=3, R=5, E=3, A=5, Di=4 → Total=20

6. Elevation of Privilege
- Container Escape to Host  
  Description: Exploit container runtime bug to break out and gain host access.  
  DREAD: D=5, R=2, E=3, A=5, Di=3 → Total=18

- Privilege Escalation via Kubelet Misconfig  
  Description: Misconfigured kubelet (e.g. allow‑privileged) lets container escalate to root on node.  
  DREAD: D=4, R=3, E=4, A=5, Di=3 → Total=19

- Malicious Image with Elevated Privileges  
  Description: Run a container image that exploits capabilities to gain host or cluster admin.  
  DREAD: D=5, R=4, E=4, A=5, Di=3 → Total=21

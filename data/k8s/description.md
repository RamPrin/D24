How Kubernetes Works
Key Concepts
Cluster: A group of nodes (machines) that run containerized applications.
Node: A worker machine in the cluster, where pods are scheduled to run.
Pod: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers.
Deployment: A controller that manages a set of identical pods, ensuring the desired number of replicas are running.
Service: An abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them.
ConfigMap: An API object used to store configuration data in key-value pairs.
Secret: An API object used to store sensitive information like passwords, tokens, or keys.
Namespace: A way to divide cluster resources between multiple users or projects.
Ingress: An API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP.
PersistentVolume (PV): A piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes.
PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC): A request for storage by a user, which is bound to a PV.
Architecture
Master Node:

API Server: The front-end for the Kubernetes control plane, exposing the Kubernetes API.
etcd: A distributed key-value store that stores the cluster data.
Controller Manager: Manages the controllers that regulate the state of the cluster.
Scheduler: Assigns pods to nodes based on resource requirements, constraints, and policies.
Worker Nodes:

Kubelet: An agent that runs on each node, ensuring that containers are running in a pod.
Kube-Proxy: Manages network rules on nodes, enabling communication to the services.
Container Runtime: Manages the lifecycle of containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).
Workflow
Deployment:

A user creates a deployment configuration, specifying the desired state (e.g., number of replicas).
The API Server stores the deployment configuration in etcd.
Scheduling:

The Scheduler assigns pods to nodes based on resource availability and constraints.
The API Server updates the state in etcd.
Pod Management:

The Kubelet on each node pulls the necessary container images and starts the containers.
The Kubelet reports the status of the pods to the API Server.
Service Discovery:

Services provide stable IP addresses and DNS names for pods.
Kube-Proxy manages network rules to route traffic to the appropriate pods.
Monitoring and Scaling:

The Controller Manager ensures that the actual state matches the desired state.
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler adjusts the number of pod replicas based on observed CPU utilization or other select metrics.

Use strong authentication mechanisms.
Regularly update and patch the Kubelet.
Kube-Proxy:

Use TLS for secure communication.
Regularly update and patch Kube-Proxy.
Container Runtime:

Use trusted container images.
Regularly update and patch the container runtime.
Use network policies to restrict traffic.
Network:

Use strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication).
Monitoring and Logging:

Implement centralized logging and monitoring.
Use intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS).
Regular Updates and Patching:

Regularly update all components.
Apply security patches promptly.
Backup and Recovery:

Regularly back up critical data.
Test backup and recovery procedures.
Security Training:

Provide regular security training for all users.
Conduct security awareness programs.
Example Threat Model
Threat: Unauthorized Access to API Server

### STRIDE Threats

#### Spoofing
- **Unauthorized Access by Attacker**: External attacker impersonates legitimate users or services to access the Kubernetes API Server. +

#### Tampering
- **Misconfigured RBAC Exploit**: Malicious insider can exploit misconfigured RBAC to alter cluster configurations. +

#### Repudiation
- **Lack of Logging and Auditing**: Without proper logging, actions performed by attackers (both insider and outsider) might go unrecorded and unrepudiated. -

#### Information Disclosure
- **Exploit Weak Authentication**: External attacker gains access to etcd due to weak authentication mechanisms. +
- **Network Interception**: Sensitive data exposed during transmission if TLS is not properly implemented. -

#### Denial of Service
- **Resource Exhaustion by Scheduler**: Malicious use of scheduler to exhaust resources and degrade service availability. +
- **API Server Flooding**: Attacker floods API Server with requests to degrade service. -

#### Elevation of Privilege
- **Privilege Escalation via Exploited Containers**: Insider or attacker exploits container runtime to gain elevated privileges within the cluster. +

**STRIDE Threats:**

- **Spoofing**
  - *Impersonation of User*: An attacker could attempt to impersonate a user to the app server by bypassing authentication during data transmission. +
  - *Impersonation of App Server*: An attacker could spoof the app server to deceive users during the data sharing process. +

- **Tampering**
  - *Data Tampering over Internet*: Proximity or personal information data could be altered in transit between user device and app server despite encryption. -
  - *Tampering with Device Data*: An attacker could tamper with proximity data on the user device before it's encrypted and submitted. +

- **Repudiation**
  - *Action Denial on User Device*: Users might deny registration actions or the submission of proximity data due to lack of logging on the device. +
  - *Data Sharing Repudiation*: Users or health authorities could deny the sharing of health data due to insufficient logging. +

- **Information Disclosure**
  - *Data Leakage from App Server*: Sensitive health and proximity data could be exposed if the app server is compromised. +
  - *Unauthorized Access to Personal Information*: Personal information may be disclosed if encryption keys are compromised. +

- **Denial of Service**
  - *User Device Overload*: An attacker may flood user devices with excessive notifications, causing denial of service to legitimate notifications. +
  - *Service Exhaustion Attack on App Server*: An attacker might overload the app server with requests, preventing legitimate data processing. +

- **Elevation of Privilege**
  - *Privilege Escalation on User Device*: Malicious apps on the device could gain elevated privileges to access encrypted proximity data. +
  - *Unauthorized Data Access on App Server*: Exploiting vulnerabilities on the app server could allow unauthorized access to sensitive data. -

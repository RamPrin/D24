RogueServerEndpoint: Attacker sets up a fake backend endpoint to collect users\u2019 encrypted data.\n- HealthAPIImpersonation: Imposter service spoofs health authority API to inject false test verifications.\n- GPSpoofing: Malicious app or tool spoofs GPS data on the user device to falsify location logs.\n\nTampering:\n- TamperLocalStorage: Attacker with device access modifies or deletes stored proximity logs.\n- MITMDataModification: Man\u2011in\u2011the\u2011middle alters encrypted data in transit before it reaches the server.\n- AppBinaryPatching: Reverse engineering and patching the app to disable upload of positive test results.\n- DatabaseRecordAlteration: Unauthorized modification of central database entries to hide or fabricate diagnoses.\n\nRepudiation:\n- SilentPositiveReport: User claims they never reported a positive test because no non\u2011repudiation log exists.\n- NotificationDenial: Server or user denies having sent or received exposure notifications without tamper\u2011proof logs.\n- MissingAuditTrail: Lack of immutable audit logs for data uploads and health authority confirmations.\n\nInformation Disclosure:\n- BLEEavesdropping: Attackers sniff BLE broadcasts to correlate UUIDs and re\u2011identify users.\n- UnencryptedLocalDump: If local storage encryption fails, proximity and location logs leak on device compromise.\n- BackendDataLeak: Central database breach exposes time\u2011stamped proximity records of users.\n- CorrelationAttack: Adversary combines GPS logs with other datasets to deanonymize users.\n\nDenial of Service:\n- BLEJamming: Radio jamming to prevent devices from detecting each other.\n- ServerFlood: Flood backend API with bogus upload requests, degrading service for all users.\n- BatteryDrainAttack: Forcing continuous high\u2011power GPS or BLE scans to exhaust device battery.\n- StorageOverflow: Inserting excessive dummy data into local logs to exhaust device storage.\n\nElevation of Privilege:\n- SQLInjection: Crafting malicious input in positive test reports to execute unauthorized database commands.\n- APIPrivilegeEscalation: Exploiting unprotected endpoints to download other users\u2019 data.\n- DebugBypass: Using rooted/jailbroken device privileges to bypass app\u2019s privacy controls and access raw logs.\n- MisconfiguredAccessControl:

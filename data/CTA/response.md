# Threats

Spoofing:
- Impersonated Devices: An attacker could broadcast a fake UUID to spoof another device.
- Fake User Registration: Unauthorized users could register fake accounts.

Tampering:
- Data Alteration: An attacker might intercept and alter data transmitted between the user's device and server.
- Malware Injection: Malicious software could tamper with the app on the user's device.

Repudiation:
- Data Change Denial: A user may deny changes made to their contact history.
- False Notification Denial: A user could deny having received notifications.

Information Disclosure:
- Unauthorized Access: Sensitive user data may be accessed if proper encryption is not implemented.
- Data Leakage: Bluetooth proximity data could be harvested by unauthorized apps.

Denial of Service:
- Service Overload: An attacker could overwhelm the server with excessive data flows.
- Bluetooth Jamming: Disruption of Bluetooth signals to prevent proximity detection.

Elevation of Privilege:
- Unauthorized Access: An attacker could exploit a vulnerability to gain higher access within the app.
- API Exploitation: Unauthorized data access by manipulating API calls.

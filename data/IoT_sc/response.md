# Threats

Spoofing:
- **Unauthorized Access to IoT Devices**: An attacker could impersonate a legitimate device to send fraudulent data.
- **Network Spoofing**: An attacker could spoof network credentials to gain unauthorized access.

Tampering:
- **Data Corruption**: An attacker may alter data during transmission between IoT devices and cloud platforms.
- **Physical Tampering**: Unauthorized personnel could tamper with IoT devices to alter data reading.

Repudiation:
- **Lack of Transaction Logging**: Inadequate logging could allow malicious actors to deny sending or receiving data.
- **False Acknowledgements**: An attacker could deny receiving commands for action execution.

Information Disclosure:
- **Intercepted Data Transfers**: An attacker could capture sensitive IoT data being transmitted over the network.
- **Inadequate Encryption**: Insufficient encryption in cloud platforms could expose sensitive analytics data.

Denial of Service:
- **Network Overload**: Deliberate network congestion could prevent timely data transmission from IoT devices.
- **Device Jamming**: An attacker could disable sensors or communication channels, disrupting services.

Elevation of Privilege:
- **Unauthorized Access to Cloud Platforms**: An attacker may exploit vulnerabilities to gain higher access levels in cloud systems.
- **Exploit Flaws in SCM Systems**: An attacker could exploit weaknesses to gain unauthorized privileges in supply chain management systems.

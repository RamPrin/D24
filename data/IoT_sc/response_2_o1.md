**DREAD Evaluation**

Use the DREAD model to evaluate the risk of each threat to understand their potential impact. Consider the following factors for each threat:

- **Damage Potential**: How serious would the impact be if the threat is realized?
- **Reproducibility**: How easy is it to reproduce the threat?
- **Exploitability**: How easy is it to exploit the threat?
- **Affected Users**: How many users would be affected?
- **Discoverability**: How likely is it that an attacker can discover the threat?

Each factor can be rated on a scale of 0 to 10. The overall risk is the average of these ratings and will guide prioritization of threat mitigation efforts.

# Threats

**Spoofing:**

- **Device Identity Spoofing:** An attacker may mimic an IoT device's identity to gain unauthorized access.
- **User Spoofing:** An attacker may impersonate an end user to access sensitive information.
- **Service Spoofing:** Fake services may present themselves as legitimate to collect data from IoT devices.

**Tampering:**

- **Data Tampering:** Attackers might alter data during transmission between IoT devices and the cloud service.
- **Gateway Manipulation:** An attacker may alter the configuration of a gateway device to divert or modify traffic.

**Repudiation:**

- **Action Repudiation:** Lack of proper logging might allow users to deny their actions within the IoT network.
- **Data Origin Repudiation:** Attackers might send data claiming it was sent from a legitimate device without proof.

**Information Disclosure:**

- **Data Leakage:** Sensitive data may be intercepted during authentication processes if not properly encrypted.
- **Credential Exposure:** Usernames, passwords, or PSKs may be exposed due to weak security measures.

**Denial of Service:**

- **Device Overload:** Attackers might flood an IoT device with requests, disrupting normal functionality.
- **Authentication Server Overload:** Attackers might flood the authentication server with requests to disrupt operations.

**Elevation of Privilege:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities to gain administrator privileges.
- **API Misuse:** Weak APIs might allow unauthorized actions or privilege escalation.

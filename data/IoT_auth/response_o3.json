Impersonation: Attacker forges device credentials to masquerade as a legitimate IoT device.\n- Gateway Spoofing: Malicious actor poses as the gateway to intercept or reroute device communications.\n- User Credential Theft: Attacker steals or guesses user credentials to access cloud services as a valid user.\n- Admin Account Takeover: Compromised administrator credentials allow full control of authentication infrastructure.\n- Auth Server Masquerade: Attacker pretends to be the authentication server to capture credentials or tokens.\n\nTampering:\n- Message Tampering in Transit: Attacker alters MQTT or HTTPS payloads to inject malicious commands or corrupt data.\n- Firmware Tampering: Unauthorized modification of device firmware to subvert authentication checks.\n- Log Tampering: Modification or deletion of authentication logs in Cloud_Service or Auth_Server to cover tracks.\n- Configuration Tampering: Unauthorized changes to gateway or cloud configuration to disable security controls.\n- Directory Data Tampering: Manipulation of stored credentials in Directory_Service to grant unauthorized access.\n\nRepudiation:\n- Insufficient Logging: Lack of detailed logs prevents proving which device or user initiated an action.\n- Log Erasure by Insider: Administrator erases or modifies logs on Auth_Server to deny responsibility for a breach.\n- Transaction Denial: User or device denies having sent critical commands or data, and no non-repudiation mechanism exists.\n- Audit Trail Gaps: Missing or inconsistent records between Cloud_Service and Auth_Server leave actions untraceable.\n\nInformation Disclosure:\n- Eavesdropping on MQTT: Attacker intercepts unencrypted or poorly encrypted MQTT traffic to read device data.\n- Credentials in Logs: Sensitive tokens or keys written to logs in Cloud_Service or Gateway expose secrets.\n- Misconfigured API: Overly verbose error messages in Cloud_Service reveal internal implementation details.\n- HSM Side\u2011Channel Leak: Physical or timing side-channel from HSM exposes private keys.\n- Directory Service Data Leak: Unauthorized read access to Directory_Service reveals user and device credentials.\n\nDenial of Service:\n- MQTT Flooding: Attacker floods the gateway with MQTT connection requests causing resource exhaustion.\n- TLS Handshake Exhaustion: Rapidly opening and closing TLS sessions to overload Cloud_Service or Auth_Server.\n- HSM Resource Starvation: Excessive key operation requests deny legitimate cryptographic operations.\n- Gateway Device Overload: DoS at the IoT_Zone gateway blocks all device\u2013cloud communication.\n- Authentication Server Crash: Malformed authentication requests exploit a bug, crashing Auth_Server.\n\nElevation of Privilege:\n- Device-to-Gateway Exploit: Compromised IoT_Device exploits a vulnerability in Gateway to gain higher privileges.\n- Role Escalation via API: End_User exploits misconfigured Cloud_Service API to perform administrator actions.\n- Token Forgery: Attacker crafts or replays JWT/OAuth tokens to gain unauthorized access to services.\n- Administrator Interface Flaw: Exploitation of admin console on Auth_Server grants system\u2011level control.\n- Cross\u2011Component Exploit: Compromise of Gateway used as pivot to attack Auth_Server and HSM with elevated rights.\n-->", "model": "", "threats": "#

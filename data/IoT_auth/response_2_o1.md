### STRIDE Threat Analysis

**Spoofing**

1. **Spoofed Authentication Server**
   - An attacker could impersonate the Authentication Server to intercept credentials.

2. **Device Impersonation**
   - An attacker could impersonate an IoT device to gain unauthorized access.

3. **Spoofed End User**
   - An attacker could masquerade as an end user to gain access to the system.

**Tampering**

1. **Dataflow Tampering (PSK)**
   - Pre-shared keys could be intercepted and tampered with during transmission.

2. **Tampered Firmware Update**
   - Firmware on the IoT device could be tampered with, altering its behavior.

**Repudiation**

1. **Repudiation of Actions**
   - Lack of logging on the Authentication Server could lead to actions not being traceable.

2. **Transaction Repudiation**
   - Without proper logging, users or devices could deny actions performed on the Gateway.

**Information Disclosure**

1. **Credential Exposure**
   - Username and Password in transit could be intercepted if not properly encrypted.

2. **Sensitive Data Leak**
   - Data flows like OAuth tokens could be exposed through inadequate encryption.

**Denial of Service**

1. **Authentication Server DoS**
   - Attackers could flood the Authentication Server with requests, rendering it unavailable.

2. **Gateway Overload**
   - The Gateway could be overwhelmed by excessive authentication attempts.

**Elevation of Privilege**

1. **Unauthorized Access**
   - Exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication protocols to gain higher access permissions.

2. **Privilege Escalation via Key Management**
   - Poor key management practices could allow attackers to escalate privileges.

### DREAD Evaluation

Each threat should be scored based on the DREAD model (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, Discoverability). The scenarios above could be assigned scores from 0 (no risk) to 10 (high risk) for each DREAD factor, creating an overall risk assessment for prioritizing threat mitigation.

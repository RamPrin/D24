Credential Exploitation: Attacker leverages vendor\u2011supplied default passwords on servers to gain access.\n- IP Spoofing to Bypass Firewall: Attacker spoofs internal IP addresses to pass firewall rules.\n- QSA Identity Forgery: Unauthorized party impersonates a Qualified Security Assessor to submit fake RoC.\n- Merchant Staff Account Spoofing: Attacker guesses or reuses credentials to appear as authorized staff.\n\nTampering:\n- In\u2011Transit Data Modification: Attacker intercepts and alters PAN or transaction details on the wire.\n- Log File Tampering: Malicious insider or attacker modifies or deletes log entries to cover tracks.\n- Configuration File Alteration: Attacker changes encryption or firewall configs to weaken protections.\n- Database Record Tampering: Unauthorized change of stored cardholder data to commit fraud.\n- AV Definition Tampering: Attacker corrupts antivirus signature database to disable malware detection.\n\nRepudiation:\n- Transaction Denial by Cardholder: Cardholder refuses to acknowledge a legitimate transaction.\n- Assessment Report Dispute: Merchant claims QSA report was never delivered or was altered.\n- Log Integrity Dispute: Insider denies actions, alleging logs are incomplete or tampered.\n- RoC Submission Denial: Acquiring bank disputes receipt of the RoC, claiming non\u2011delivery.\n\nInformation Disclosure:\n- Eavesdropping on PAN: Attacker captures unencrypted PAN on public or internal networks.\n- Stored Data Exposure: Unauthorized retrieval of database backups containing cardholder data.\n- Misconfigured Storage Bucket: Publicly accessible backup or RoC repository leaks sensitive data.\n- Log Data Leakage: Sensitive card details in logs exposed to unauthorized viewers.\n- Assessment Data Interception: Self\u2011assessment data in transit to QSA captured in clear.\n\nDenial of Service:\n- Firewall Flooding: High volume traffic overwhelms firewall, blocking legitimate transactions.\n- Web Server Application DoS: Attackers exploit application logic to exhaust server resources.\n- Database Connection Starvation: Excessive bogus requests exhaust DB connection pool.\n- SIEM Overload: Log storm causes SIEM to drop alerts or become unresponsive.\n- Assessment System DoS: Targeted attack prevents self\u2011assessment uploads, delaying compliance.\n\nElevation of Privilege:\n- Local Privilege Escalation on App Server: Exploit unpatched vulnerability to gain root/admin.\n- Misconfigured ACLs on DB: Unauthorized user gains write access to CDE database.\n- SIEM Admin Takeover: Weak credentials allow attacker to assume SIEM administrator role.\n- Assessment System Privilege Escalation: Attacker escalates from merchant user to QSA role.\n- Container Escape on Web Server: Attacker breaks out of container to gain host\u2011level access.", "model": "\nfrom pytm import TM, Boundary, Actor, Server, DataFlow, DataStore\n\ntm = TM(\"PCI DSS Compliance Environment\")\n\n#

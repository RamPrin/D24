# Threats

Spoofing:
- **Unauthorized Access to Firewall**: An attacker may spoof an admin user to access and configure the firewall.
  
Tampering:
- **Alteration of Cardholder Data**: An attacker could tamper with the data flow between the application server and database server to alter cardholder data.
  
Repudiation:
- **Unlogged Access**: An admin could perform unlogged access to the firewall, resulting in actions that cannot be repudiated.
  
Information Disclosure:
- **Data Leak in Transit**: Unencrypted transmission might expose cardholder data if encryption measures fail.
  
Denial of Service:
- **Network Overload on Firewall**: An overwhelming number of requests could be sent to the firewall to disrupt legitimate traffic.
  
Elevation of Privilege:
- **Privilege Escalation via Malware**: An attacker could exploit a vulnerability to escalate privileges to access the database server without authorization.

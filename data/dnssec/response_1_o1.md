# Threats

Spoofing:
- "Fake DNS Responses": An attacker may send falsified DNS responses to mislead the client. - 
- "Identity Misrepresentation": An attacker might spoof the identity of the DNS server. +

Tampering:
- "DNS Record Tampering": An attacker alters DNS records to redirect traffic. +
- "Signature Manipulation": An attacker modifies RRSIG records to make them invalid. -

Repudiation:
- "Admin Activity Repudiation": The zone administrator could deny actions taken in updating DNSKEY records. -
  
Information Disclosure:
- "Sensitive Data Exposure": Misconfigured DNSSEC might expose sensitive data in DNS records. -
- "Zone Data Leakage": The complete zone data might be leaked through NSEC walking. +

Denial of Service:
- "DNS Flooding": An attacker overwhelms the DNS server with excessive queries. +
- "Resource Exhaustion": An attacker consumes resources by constantly querying for non-existent records. +

Elevation of Privilege:
- "Privilege Escalation through Misconfiguration": An incorrect DNSSEC setup might allow attackers to gain unauthorized access. -
- "Key Misuse": If an attacker gains access to KSK/ZSK, they can sign malicious records. +

DNS Response: Attacker sends spoofed DNSSEC response claiming to be from AuthDNS.\n- Fake DNSKEY Injection: Attacker injects a malicious DNSKEY record to bypass signature checks.\n- Spoofed NSEC/NSEC3 Record: Attacker forges authenticated denial of existence to hide or fake records.\n- Resolver Impersonation: Attacker pretends to be the resolver to intercept client queries.\n\nTampering:\n- In-Transit DNS Record Modification: Attacker alters DNS record data or signatures as they travel.\n- Zone File Tampering: Insider or attacker modifies zone data in ZoneDB to redirect domains.\n- Private Key Tampering: Attacker replaces or corrupts ZSK/KSK in KeyStore to break signature trust.\n- RRSIG Record Tampering: Attacker modifies RRSIG values in responses to cause verification failures.\n\nRepudiation:\n- Lack of Audit Logging: No immutable logs at AuthDNS or resolver allow denial of signing actions.\n- Log Tampering: Attacker or insider alters DNSSEC operation logs to erase trace of malicious changes.\n- Client Query Denial: Client repudiates having sent or received specific DNS queries without proof.\n- Resolver Response Denial: Resolver denies having served or cached specific DNSSEC responses.\n\nInformation Disclosure:\n- DNS Query Eavesdropping: Passive attacker captures client queries, exposing browsing behavior.\n- Zone Transfer Leakage: Unauthorized AXFR exposes entire zone contents, revealing private hostnames.\n- KeyStore Data Breach: Compromise of KeyStore leaks private ZSK/KSK, allowing signature forgeries.\n- DNS Cache Snooping: Attacker infers resolver cache contents and client activity by timing attacks.\n\nDenial of Service:\n- DNSSEC Amplification Attack: Large signed responses used in UDP reflection floods.\n- Signature Computation Exhaustion: Flood of signature requests overwhelms AuthDNS CPU.\n- UDP Flooding on Port\u00a053: Volumetric attack against resolver or AuthDNS to disrupt DNS service.\n- Chain-of-Trust Disruption: Attacker blocks DNSKEY or DS delivery, causing resolver validation failures.\n\nElevation of Privilege:\n- Unauthorized Zone Transfer: Attacker abuses AXFR to steal zone and craft malicious responses.\n- KSK Rollover Abuse: Attacker injects rogue KSK during rollover to gain signing authority.\n- TSIG/Dynamic Update Exploit: Attacker uses misconfigured TSIG keys to inject unauthorized records.\n- Resolver Cache Poisoning: Attacker injects forged records into resolver cache to redirect clients.", "model": "\nfrom pytm import TM, Boundary, Actor, Server, Store, Process,

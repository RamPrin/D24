CT log to accept certificates and issue fraudulent SCTs.  \n- Impersonate Monitor: An attacker pretends to be a monitor to send false alerts or suppress genuine ones.  \n- Impersonate Auditor: A malicious party poses as an auditor to wrongly certify a CA\u2019s non\u2011compliance.  \n- Spoof CT Log in Client Queries: A man\u2011in\u2011the\u2011middle spoofs the CT log endpoint when the client requests inclusion proofs.\n\nTampering:\n- Log Entry Modification: Unauthorized modification or deletion of entries in a CT log\u2019s storage.  \n- SCT Replay: Reuse of an old SCT to masquerade as a validly logged certificate post\u2011revocation.  \n- SCT Injection: An attacker intercepts and alters the SCT in a certificate to hide actual log events.  \n- Forge Log Signatures: Compromise of the CT log\u2019s private key to generate fake Merkle tree roots or SCTs.  \n\nRepudiation:\n- CA Denial of Issuance: A CA denies ever issuing a certificate that appears in the CT log.  \n- CT Log Denial of Receipt: The CT log operator denies receiving a submission for a given certificate.  \n- Monitor Denies Alert: A monitor claims it never generated an alert for a fraudulent certificate.  \n- Auditor Denial of Audit: An auditor denies having performed required compliance checks on a CA or log.\n\nInformation Disclosure:\n- Private Key Leakage: Exposure of CA or CT log private keys enabling forgery of certificates or SCTs.  \n- Unpublished Log Leak: Unauthorized access to raw or pre\u2011published log data revealing certificate metadata.  \n- Monitor Data Exposure: Leakage of sensitive monitoring logs (e.g., domain names under watch).  \n- Client Query Leak: Observation of client inclusion\u2011proof lookups to infer browsing history or visited domains.  \n\nDenial of Service:\n- CT Log Flooding: High\u2011volume bogus certificate submissions to overwhelm the CT log service.  \n- Monitor Overload: Flooding the monitor with benign anomalies so genuine threats go undetected.  \n- Auditor Service DoS: Targeted attacks on auditor endpoints to prevent compliance verification.  \n- CA Issuance Service DoS: Disrupting the CA\u2019s issuance pipeline, halting certificate creation and logging.\n\nElevation of Privilege:\n- CA Privilege Escalation: A compromised CA insider elevates privileges to bypass CT logging.  \n- CT Log Admin Compromise: An attacker gains admin rights on the CT log to manipulate or delete entries.  \n- Auditor Privilege Escalation: An attacker escalates to auditor role to falsify compliance reports.  \n- Client Privilege Abuse: A malicious client gains unauthorized rights to submit or modify logs directly.", "model": "\nfrom pytm import TM, Boundary, Actor, Process, Server, Dataflow\n\n# Initialize Threat Model\ntm =

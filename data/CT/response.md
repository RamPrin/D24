# Threats

Spoofing:
- Unauthenticated Monitor Access: The monitor could be spoofed, leading to false reports or no alerts.
- Unauthenticated Auditor Access: An unauthenticated entity could impersonate an auditor and provide misleading audit results.

Tampering:
- Log Entry Modification: An attacker could attempt to modify log entries in the CT logs.
- Certificate Tampering: An attacker might tamper with a certificate before it is logged.

Repudiation:
- Monitor Activity Repudiation: Monitors might deny their activities or alerts.
- Audit Result Repudiation: Auditors could repudiate previous audit reports or findings.

Information Disclosure:
- Unauthorized Access to Logs: Unauthorized entities could access CT logs and extract sensitive information.
- Monitoring Data Leak: Sensitive data collected by monitors might be exposed if not properly secured.

Denial of Service:
- Log Availability Attack: An attacker could attempt to overwhelm a CT log to prevent it from recording or serving entries.
- Monitor Overload: An attacker might overwhelm monitors with bogus data, causing them to miss genuine threats.

Elevation of Privilege:
- Compromised CA: A compromised CA could issue fraudulent certificates despite CT monitoring.
- Unauthorized Log Administration: Someone could gain elevated privileges to administer CT logs improperly.

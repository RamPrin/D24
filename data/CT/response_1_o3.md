# Threats
Spoofing:
- Fake CA: An attacker impersonates a CA to issue fraudulent certificates without logging them. +  
- Fake CT Log: A malicious actor stands up a rogue CT log to accept certificates and issue fraudulent SCTs. +
- Impersonate Monitor: An attacker pretends to be a monitor to send false alerts or suppress genuine ones.  +
- Impersonate Auditor: A malicious party poses as an auditor to wrongly certify a CA’s non‑compliance.  +
- Spoof CT Log in Client Queries: A man‑in‑the‑middle spoofs the CT log endpoint when the client requests inclusion proofs. -

Tampering:
- Log Entry Modification: Unauthorized modification or deletion of entries in a CT log’s storage. -  
- SCT Replay: Reuse of an old SCT to masquerade as a validly logged certificate post‑revocation.  -
- SCT Injection: An attacker intercepts and alters the SCT in a certificate to hide actual log events. -  
- Forge Log Signatures: Compromise of the CT log’s private key to generate fake Merkle tree roots or SCTs. +  

Repudiation:
- CA Denial of Issuance: A CA denies ever issuing a certificate that appears in the CT log. +
- CT Log Denial of Receipt: The CT log operator denies receiving a submission for a given certificate. +  
- Monitor Denies Alert: A monitor claims it never generated an alert for a fraudulent certificate.  -
- Auditor Denial of Audit: An auditor denies having performed required compliance checks on a CA or log. -

Information Disclosure:
- Private Key Leakage: Exposure of CA or CT log private keys enabling forgery of certificates or SCTs. +
- Unpublished Log Leak: Unauthorized access to raw or pre‑published log data revealing certificate metadata. +  
- Monitor Data Exposure: Leakage of sensitive monitoring logs (e.g., domain names under watch). +
- Client Query Leak: Observation of client inclusion‑proof lookups to infer browsing history or visited domains. -  

Denial of Service:
- CT Log Flooding: High‑volume bogus certificate submissions to overwhelm the CT log service. -
- Monitor Overload: Flooding the monitor with benign anomalies so genuine threats go undetected. -   
- Auditor Service DoS: Targeted attacks on auditor endpoints to prevent compliance verification.  +
- CA Issuance Service DoS: Disrupting the CA’s issuance pipeline, halting certificate creation and logging. +

Elevation of Privilege:
- CA Privilege Escalation: A compromised CA insider elevates privileges to bypass CT logging.  +
- CT Log Admin Compromise: An attacker gains admin rights on the CT log to manipulate or delete entries. +  
- Auditor Privilege Escalation: An attacker escalates to auditor role to falsify compliance reports.  -
- Client Privilege Abuse: A malicious client gains unauthorized rights to submit or modify logs directly. -

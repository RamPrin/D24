Threats\n\nSpoofing:\n- User Impersonation: Attacker masquerades as a legitimate user to submit credentials and gain unauthorized access.\n- Service Spoofing: Attacker poses as AuthService to trick the PSM into processing malicious requests.\n- Component Impersonation: Malicious process pretends to be the PSM to intercept or manipulate password flows.\n\nTampering:\n- In\u2011Transit Modification: Attacker intercepts and alters password or hash traffic between AuthService and PSM.\n- Database Tampering: Attacker modifies stored hashes or salts in PasswordDatabase to bypass authentication.\n- Audit Log Manipulation: Unauthorized party alters or deletes entries in AuditLog to cover tracks.\n- Configuration Tampering: Attacker changes PSM configuration (e.g., KDF iteration count) to weaken security.\n\nRepudiation:\n- Log Deletion: Actor deletes or modifies audit logs to deny having performed sensitive operations.\n- Incomplete Logging: Missing or insufficient audit entries let a user repudiate registration or login events.\n- Timestamp Manipulation: Modification of log timestamps to dispute the timing of authentication or changes.\n\nInformation Disclosure:\n- Cleartext Exposure: Passwords are logged or cached in cleartext in AuthService or PSM logs.\n- Hash/\u200bSalt Leakage: Database compromise leads to exposure of password hashes and salts for offline cracking.\n- Side\u2011Channel Leakage: Timing or error messages during verification reveal information about password validity.\n- Backup Exposure: Insecure backups of PasswordDatabase or keys lead to bulk disclosure of credentials.\n\nDenial of Service:\n- KDF Exhaustion: Attacker floods PSM with hash/verify requests to exhaust CPU resources.\n- Storage Exhaustion: Attacker injects large or frequent entries to fill up PasswordDatabase or AuditLog.\n- Network Flooding: DDoS on AuthService or PSM disrupts legitimate authentication traffic.\n- Backup Lockout: Corruption or unavailability of backups prevents recovery after legitimate failures.\n\nElevation of Privilege:\n- API Abuse: Unauthorized user exploits weak PSM API endpoints to read or write password data directly.\n- Privilege Escalation in PSM: Flawed access control in PSM allows low\u2011privilege processes to perform high\u2011privilege operations.\n- Injection Attacks: SQL or command injection on PasswordDatabase allows execution of arbitrary queries or code.\n- Misconfigured Encryption Keys: Attacker with partial access uses weak key management to decrypt entire database.", "model": "\nfrom pytm import TM, Boundary,

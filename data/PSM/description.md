A Password Storage Module (PSM) is a critical component in systems that handle user authentication. Its primary function is to securely store and manage user passwords, ensuring that they are protected against unauthorized access and breaches. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how a Password Storage Module works:

Core Components
User Credentials:

Username: The unique identifier used to access the account.
Password: The secret information used to verify the user's identity.
Hashing Algorithms:

Cryptographic Functions: Algorithms that convert passwords into fixed-size strings of characters, making it computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer the original password from the hash.
Salt:

Random Data: Unique, non-secret data added to the password before hashing to protect against rainbow table attacks and ensure that identical passwords have different hashes.
Key Derivation Functions (KDFs):

Iterative Hashing: Functions that apply a cryptographic hash function multiple times to slow down brute-force attacks and improve security.
Secure Storage:

Database: A secure database where hashed passwords and other relevant information are stored.
Encryption: Encrypting the stored data to protect it from unauthorized access.
Access Control:

Authentication Mechanisms: Ensuring that only authorized processes can access the password storage module.
Audit Logs: Keeping records of access and modifications to the password storage.
Backup and Recovery:

Secure Backups: Creating secure backups of the password storage to prevent data loss.
Recovery Procedures: Defining procedures for restoring password storage in case of data loss or corruption.
Key Processes
Password Collection:

User Input: Collecting the user's password during the registration or login process.
Validation: Ensuring the password meets complexity requirements (e.g., length, character types).
Password Hashing:

Salting: Adding a unique salt to the password before hashing.
Hashing: Applying a cryptographic hash function to the salted password to generate a hash.
Key Derivation: Using a KDF to apply the hash function multiple times, increasing the computational cost of brute-force attacks.
Storage:

Database Insertion: Storing the hashed password and associated salt in a secure database.
Encryption: Encrypting the stored data to protect it from unauthorized access.
Password Verification:

User Input: Collecting the user's password during the login process.
Salting: Retrieving the stored salt associated with the user's account.
Hashing: Hashing the input password with the retrieved salt.
Comparison: Comparing the generated hash with the stored hash to verify the password.
Access Control:

Authentication: Ensuring that only authorized processes can access the password storage module.
Authorization: Granting permissions based on the user's role and responsibilities.
Audit Logging:

Access Records: Keeping records of who accessed the password storage and when.
Modification Records: Logging any changes made to the password storage.
Backup and Recovery:

Regular Backups: Creating regular backups of the password storage to prevent data loss.
Secure Storage: Storing backups in a secure location, such as an encrypted external drive or a secure cloud service.
Recovery Procedures: Defining and testing procedures for restoring password storage in case of data loss or corruption.

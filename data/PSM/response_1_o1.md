To model the Password Storage Module (PSM) using the PyTM library and perform a threat analysis using the STRIDE methodology, we need to define the boundaries, components, and dataflows first. Here's how you can structure the PyTM model and identify potential threats:

# Model:
```python
from pytm import TM, Server, Dataflow, Boundary, Actor, Datastore, Process

# Define boundaries
internal_boundary = Boundary(name="Internal Network")

# Define components
user = Actor(name="User")
password_storage = Datastore(name="Password Storage", in_boundary=internal_boundary)
auth_mechanism = Process(name="Authentication Mechanism", in_boundary=internal_boundary)
hashing_process = Process(name="Hashing Process", in_boundary=internal_boundary)

# Define dataflows
user_input_flow = Dataflow(name="User Input", source=user, destination=auth_mechanism)
password_hash_flow = Dataflow(name="Password Hash Flow", source=hashing_process, destination=password_storage)
verification_flow = Dataflow(name="Password Verification", source=auth_mechanism, destination=password_storage)

# Initialize and process the threat model
tm = TM("Password Storage Module Threat Model")
tm += [user, password_storage, auth_mechanism, hashing_process, user_input_flow, password_hash_flow, verification_flow]
tm.process()
```

# Threats

Spoofing:
- **Unauthorized Access**: An attacker could impersonate a legitimate user to gain access to the system.
- **Spoofed Actor**: Malicious entities might spoof the user or service identities to gain unauthorized access.

Tampering:
- **Data Tampering**: An attacker could modify the hash or salt stored in the database.
- **Code Injection**: An attacker could inject malicious code to alter the hashing process.

Repudiation:
- **Log Manipulation**: Attackers could modify audit logs to hide their unauthorized actions.
- **Insufficient Logging**: Absence of logging could lead to a lack of accountability for actions.

Information Disclosure:
- **Data Breach**: Unencrypted or weakly encrypted data in the password storage could be exposed.
- **Hash Disclosure**: Weak protection of hashes might lead to exposure during transmission or in backup storage.

Denial of Service:
- **Brute Force Attacks**: An attacker might overload the system with login attempts, causing service outages.
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Continuous resource-intensive operations, like hashing with KDFs, can degrade system performance.

Elevation of Privilege:
- **Privilege Escalation**: An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities to gain higher-level access.
- **Insecure Backup Access**: Improperly secured backup storage could allow unauthorized privilege escalation.

Analyses like these help in understanding potential risks and fortifying the system against possible threats.

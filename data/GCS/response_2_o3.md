STRIDE Threats for “Google Cloud Storage Threat Model”

1. SPOOFING  
  • Spoofed API Requests  
    – An attacker steals or forges GCS user credentials (OAuth tokens, API keys) to call the GCS API as a legitimate principal.  
    DREAD: D=9, R=7, E=6, A=8, D=7 (Total=37)  
  • Impersonate KMS Endpoint  
    – A malicious actor performs a MITM or DNS‑spoof against the gRPC channel to Cloud KMS, returning fake Data Encryption Keys.  
    DREAD: D=8, R=5, E=5, A=7, D=6 (Total=31)  

2. TAMPERING  
  • Modify Data In‑Transit  
    – Intercept and alter HTTPS requests/responses to change object contents or request parameters en route to GCS API.  
    DREAD: D=8, R=6, E=7, A=7, D=8 (Total=36)  
  • Tamper Stored Objects/Metadata  
    – Gain unauthorized write access (e.g. via IAM misconfig) and alter object data or metadata at rest in the GCS bucket.  
    DREAD: D=9, R=4, E=5, A=8, D=5 (Total=31)  
  • Alter Bucket Configuration  
    – Modify bucket ACLs, lifecycle rules or versioning settings to weaken security or retention guarantees.  
    DREAD: D=7, R=3, E=4, A=6, D=4 (Total=24)  

3. REPUDIATION  
  • Insufficient Audit Logging  
    – Lack of detailed, tamper‑proof logs for object operations lets users deny or obscure malicious deletes, uploads or reads.  
    DREAD: D=6, R=8, E=4, A=8, D=6 (Total=32)  

4. INFORMATION DISCLOSURE  
  • Eavesdrop gRPC Internal Flows  
    – Capture unencrypted gRPC traffic between GCS API and the bucket or KMS to read object data or metadata.  
    DREAD: D=9, R=6, E=5, A=6, D=7 (Total=33)  
  • Misconfigured ACL/IAM Exposure  
    – Public‑read or overly broad IAM roles expose sensitive buckets/objects to unauthorized viewers.  
    DREAD: D=8, R=7, E=7, A=7, D=7 (Total=36)  
  • Compromise of DEK  
    – An attacker obtains the plaintext Data Encryption Key (e.g. via KMS breach), decrypts all bucket objects.  
    DREAD: D=9, R=3, E=4, A=8, D=5 (Total=29)  

5. DENIAL OF SERVICE  
  • API Flooding  
    – High‑volume malicious HTTPS requests exhaust GCS API quotas or compute resources, disrupting service.  
    DREAD: D=7, R=9, E=8, A=9, D=8 (Total=41)  
  • Storage Quota Exhaustion  
    – Upload massive objects or infinite looping writes to fill bucket storage limits, preventing legitimate writes.  
    DREAD: D=6, R=8, E=8, A=8, D=7 (Total=37)  
  • KMS Throttling/Outage  
    – Target Cloud KMS with requests or exploit faults to deny DEK issuance, blocking encryption/decryption.  
    DREAD: D=8, R=4, E=5, A=6, D=7 (Total=30)  

6. ELEVATION OF PRIVILEGE  
  • IAM Misconfiguration Abuse  
    – Exploit overly permissive IAM roles to gain Storage Admin privileges, enabling full bucket/object control.  
    DREAD: D=9, R=5, E=5, A=8, D=6 (Total=33)  
  • API Vulnerability Exploit  
    – Use a flaw (race condition or injection) in the GCS API to bypass object ACLs or privilege checks.  
    DREAD: D=8, R=4, E=4, A=7, D=5 (Total=28)  
  • Unauthorized Key Creation  
    – Abusing Cloud KMS misconfig or API flaw to generate or import DEKs without proper authorization, then decrypt data.  
    DREAD: D=9, R=4, E=4, A=7, D=6 (Total=30)

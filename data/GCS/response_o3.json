Threats\n<!---\nSpoofing:\n- Credential Theft: Attacker steals user or service account credentials to impersonate legitimate users.\n- Signed URL Forgery: Attacker crafts or replays signed URLs to gain unauthorized object access.\n- API Endpoint Spoofing: DNS or MITM attack redirects SDK/Console calls to a malicious endpoint.\n- KMS Service Impersonation: Attacker mimics KMS to supply attacker-controlled keys.\n\nTampering:\n- In-Transit Data Tampering: Alter object data or metadata during upload/download if TLS is broken.\n- Bucket Policy Tampering: Unauthorized modification of bucket IAM policies or ACLs.\n- Object Metadata Modification: Malicious change of object metadata (e.g., content-type, retention).\n- Audit Log Tampering: Deletion or modification of audit logs to cover malicious actions.\n\nRepudiation:\n- Log Deletion: Insider deletes or disables Cloud Audit Logs to hide actions.\n- Insufficient Logging: Missing detailed logs (e.g., source IP, timestamp) allows denial of actions.\n- Unsynchronized Clocks: Clock skew across services prevents reliable event ordering and non-repudiation.\n- Unlinked Actions: Actions performed by chained service accounts lack binding to original user.\n\nInformation Disclosure:\n- Public Bucket Exposure: Misconfigured ACLs or policies make buckets or objects publicly readable.\n- Unencrypted Data in Transit: Downgrade attacks force non\u2011TLS channels exposing data.\n- KMS Key Exposure: Compromise of encryption keys in KMS leaks object contents at rest.\n- Cross-Region Leak: Replication service misconfiguration exposes data across projects or regions.\n- Metadata Leakage: Sensitive metadata (e.g., object names, sizes) exposed via list operations.\n\nDenial of Service:\n- API Rate Limit Exhaustion: Flooding REST API to exhaust project\u2019s quota, blocking legitimate calls.\n- Storage Quota Exhaustion: Attacker uploads large volumes of data to consume customer\u2019s storage quota.\n- Large Object Upload Attacks: Repeated huge multipart uploads destabilize service performance.\n- Replication Storm: Abuse of cross\u2011region replication to saturate internal network.\n- Lifecycle Policy Misuse: Crafting rapid versioning/lifecycle rules to trigger massive deletions or transitions.\n\nElevation of Privilege:\n- Overly Permissive IAM Roles: Granting broad roles (e.g., Storage Admin) allows privilege escalation.\n- ACL Misconfiguration: Public \u201callUsers\u201d write permissions enable unauthorized data writes.\n- Cross-Project Access: Service account misbinding across projects grants unintended access.\n- KMS IAM Policy Misconfiguration: Weak KMS key policies allow non\u2011owners to decrypt or re\u2011encrypt data.\n- Service Account Impersonation: Exploiting GCP IAM to impersonate higher\u2011privilege service accounts.\n-->", "model": "", "threats": "# Threats\n<!---\nSpoofing:\n- Credential Theft: Attacker steals user or service account credentials to impersonate

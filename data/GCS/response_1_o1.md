# Threats

Spoofing:
- Unauthorized Access: Malicious actors could attempt to spoof legitimate user credentials to gain unauthorized access to the Google Cloud Storage system.

Tampering:
- Altered Data: Unauthorized users might alter objects within a bucket without proper controls, affecting data integrity.
- Bucket Misconfiguration: Malicious changes to bucket configurations can lead to exposure of sensitive data.

Repudiation:
- Action Denial: Users may deny actions they have taken, such as deleting or altering objects, complicating auditing efforts.

Information Disclosure:
- Data Leak: Improper permissions could expose sensitive data stored in objects or buckets to unauthorized users.
- Metadata Exposure: Access to object metadata without authorization could reveal sensitive information about the data.

Denial of Service:
- Service Overload: Malicious users could flood the service with create, upload, or delete requests to degrade performance or availability.
- Network Congestion: High volume requests could strain the network, causing delays or timeouts in accessing objects.

Elevation of Privilege:
- Unauthorized Operations: Exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities could provide attackers with elevated privileges, allowing them to perform restricted operations.
- Misconfigured IAM Policies: Incorrectly set IAM policies might grant excessive permissions, leading to privilege escalation.

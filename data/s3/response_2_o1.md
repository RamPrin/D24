**STRIDE Threats:**

**Spoofing:**
1. Fake User Identity: An attacker could impersonate a legitimate user to gain unauthorized access to the bucket.

**Tampering:**
2. Data Tampering in Transit: Modifying object data being uploaded or retrieved through the internet.
3. Modify Access Control Data: Unauthorized changes to access control data affecting bucket or object permissions.

**Repudiation:**
4. Action Repudiation: Users can deny actions like uploading or deleting objects if logging is not properly implemented.

**Information Disclosure:**
5. Data Leak via Interception: Sensitive object data could be intercepted in transit, lacking proper encryption.
6. Access Control Data Exposure: Inadequate protection of access control data can lead to unauthorized information disclosure.

**Denial of Service (DoS):**
7. Service Overload: Excessive bucket creation or object upload requests could lead to service unavailability.
8. Object Store Overload: Large volume of malicious requests to retrieve or list objects could result in a denial of service.

**Elevation of Privilege:**
9. Privilege Escalation via Misconfigured Access Controls: Attackers exploiting misconfigured access controls to gain elevated access.

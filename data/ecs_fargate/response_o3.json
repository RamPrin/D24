forges ECS API requests to AWS API to create or modify tasks.\n- Metadata Service Spoofing: A malicious container sets up a fake metadata service endpoint to harvest IAM credentials.\n- Registry Spoofing: Pulling a malicious image from a compromised or spoofed container registry.\n\nTampering:\n- Task Definition Tampering: Unauthorized modification of the task definition (image, environment variables, commands).\n- Container Image Tampering: Alteration of container images in the registry to include malware.\n- In\u2011Transit Data Tampering: Man\u2011in\u2011the\u2011middle altering API calls between DevOps User and AWS API or between scheduler and registry.\n- CloudWatch Log Tampering: Interception and modification or deletion of logs in transit.\n\nRepudiation:\n- Insufficient API Logging: ECS API calls not fully logged or logs not protected, allowing an attacker to deny illicit changes.\n- Log Retention Misconfiguration: CloudWatch Logs retention settings too short or logs mutable, enabling erasure of evidence.\n- Task Execution Ambiguity: Lack of per-task audit trail preventing attribution of actions to a specific task or role.\n\nInformation Disclosure:\n- Metadata Credential Leak: Tasks using IMDSv1 may expose IAM credentials to any process inside container.\n- Sensitive Env Var Logging: Environment variables or secrets inadvertently written to CloudWatch logs.\n- Unencrypted Dataflows: Metadata service traffic over HTTP can be intercepted.\n- Excessive IAM Permissions: Over\u2011privileged task roles allow read access to S3 buckets, secrets, or other sensitive resources.\n\nDenial of Service:\n- ECS API Flooding: Attackers flood ECS API with requests, exhausting rate limits and blocking legitimate operations.\n- Resource Exhaustion: Containers request excessive CPU/memory causing Fargate capacity exhaustion for other tasks.\n- Log Flooding: Tasks generate excessive logs, exhausting CloudWatch Logs ingestion quotas or storage.\n- Scheduler Overload: Rapid creation/deletion of tasks overwhelms the Fargate scheduler.\n\nElevation of Privilege:\n- Container Escape: Exploiting a vulnerability in the Fargate runtime to gain host-level or hypervisor-level access.\n- IAM Role Escalation: Modifying task role policy to include higher\u2011privilege actions.\n- Service Role Misuse: Misconfigured execution role allowing tasks to assume broader AWS service roles.\n- Cross\u2011Task Privilege Escalation: One task accesses another task\u2019s network namespace or metadata.", "model": "", "threats": "# Threats\nSpoofing:\n- API Request

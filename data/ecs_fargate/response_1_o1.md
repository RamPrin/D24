# Threats

Spoofing:
- **Fake Container Definition Submission**: An attacker could submit a malicious container definition via spoofed network requests. +
- **Spoofed IAM Role Assumption**: An attacker might impersonate a task to assume an unauthorized IAM role. +

Tampering:
- **Task Definition Alteration**: An attacker could modify the task definition JSON to change configurations. +
- **Log Data Compromise**: Tamper with logs in transit to hide malicious activities. -

Repudiation:
- **Task Invocation Non-repudiation**: Lack of logging for task executions may allow denial of initiating tasks. -
- **Log Access Non-repudiation**: Users accessing logs without evidence, denying malicious activity. -

Information Disclosure:
- **Exposure of Sensitive Container Configurations**: Intercepted container definitions revealing secrets. +
- **Unintended Data Access via IAM Roles**: Misconfigured roles allowing data access disclosure. +

Denial of Service:
- **Service Overwhelm**: Overloading the cluster with tasks to disrupt services. +
- **Logging Flood**: Excessive log entries impacting performance. -

Elevation of Privilege:
- **Unauthorized Task Execution**: Exploiting misconfigurations to execute privileged tasks. +
- **Privilege Escalation via IAM Roles**: Gaining elevated permissions via improper IAM role configurations. +

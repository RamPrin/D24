How ECS Fargate Works
Container Definition:

You define the container specifications, including the Docker image, memory, CPU, and other resources required for your application.
This is done through a container definition, which is a JSON document.
Task Definition:

A task definition is a blueprint for your application. It includes one or more container definitions and specifies how they should be run together.
You can also define networking, IAM roles, and other configurations in a task definition.
Service or Task:

You can run a task directly or use a service to manage and maintain a specified number of task instances running at any given time.
Services are useful for long-running applications, while tasks are suitable for one-time or periodic tasks.
Cluster:

A cluster is a logical grouping of tasks and services. In Fargate, you donâ€™t manage the underlying infrastructure, but you still need to create a cluster to run tasks and services.
Clusters in Fargate are virtual and do not require you to provision or manage EC2 instances.
Networking:

ECS Fargate uses VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds) to provide network isolation and security.
You can specify subnets, security groups, and assign public or private IP addresses to your tasks.
IAM Roles:

ECS tasks can assume IAM roles to grant permissions to access other AWS services.
This is managed through task execution roles and task roles.
Logging:

ECS Fargate supports logging to Amazon CloudWatch Logs, which helps in monitoring and troubleshooting.

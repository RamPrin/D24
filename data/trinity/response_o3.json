Attacker operates a fake IOTA node to intercept, modify, or drop transactions.  \n- 2FA_Token_Spoofing: An adversary intercepts or predicts 2FA tokens to bypass second\u2011factor checks.  \n- HardwareWallet_Spoofing: Fake hardware wallet device impersonates a legitimate signer to steal signing requests.  \n\nTampering:\n- LocalStorage_Tampering: Attacker modifies encrypted DB (e.g., alters balances or TX history) if encryption key is compromised.  \n- UI_Code_Injection: Malicious JavaScript is injected into the UI (via a compromised update or XSS) to exfiltrate seed.  \n- SignedTX_Tampering: Interceptor modifies the signed transaction payload before it\u2019s sent to the node.  \n- Backup_File_Tampering: An attacker alters seed\u2011phrase backup files, leading to loss or redirection of funds upon recovery.  \n\nRepudiation:\n- Missing_TX_Audit_Logs: No reliable proof that a user initiated or approved a given transaction.  \n- Unlogged_2FA_Events: Lack of tamper\u2011evident logs for 2FA actions prevents proving or disproving authorization.  \n- Seed_Access_Nonrepudiation: No audit trail of when or how the seed phrase was exported or accessed from the seed manager.  \n\nInformation Disclosure:\n- Seed_In_Memory_Leak: Seed or private keys reside in memory and could be extracted by malware or memory\u2011dump tools.  \n- Unencrypted_Backups: Users store backups unencrypted, exposing seed phrases if the storage medium is compromised.  \n- UI_XSS: Cross\u2011site scripting in the web UI leaks sensitive data (seeds, balances) to attackers.  \n- Network_Sniffing: Traffic between backend and public node not properly authenticated or encrypted, allowing eavesdropping.  \n\nDenial of Service:\n- Node_DOS_Via_Slowloris: Attacker floods the wallet\u2019s node interface with slow requests, preventing TX broadcasts.  \n- LocalStorage_Fill: Malicious or buggy process fills disk/storage quota, preventing new TX history writes or wallet startup.  \n- UI_Render_DOS: Excessive or malformed transaction history loading causes the UI to hang or crash.  \n\nElevation of Privilege:\n- Backend_Code_Injection: Exploitation of a vulnerability in backend logic to execute arbitrary code with user\u2019s OS privileges.  \n- 2FA_Bypass_Elevation: Flawed 2FA implementation lets an attacker elevate privileges by skipping second factor.  \n- RPC_Admin_Action: Attacker invokes internal RPC/API endpoints (e.g., seed export, fund transfer) without proper auth.", "model": "", "threats": "# Threats\nSpoofing:\n- UI_Spoofing: A malicious app

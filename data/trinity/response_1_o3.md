# Threats
Spoofing:
- UI_Spoofing: A malicious app mimics the Trinity UI to trick users into revealing seed or credentials.  
- Node_Spoofing: Attacker operates a fake IOTA node to intercept, modify, or drop transactions.  
- 2FA_Token_Spoofing: An adversary intercepts or predicts 2FA tokens to bypass second‑factor checks.  
- HardwareWallet_Spoofing: Fake hardware wallet device impersonates a legitimate signer to steal signing requests.  

Tampering:
- LocalStorage_Tampering: Attacker modifies encrypted DB (e.g., alters balances or TX history) if encryption key is compromised.  
- UI_Code_Injection: Malicious JavaScript is injected into the UI (via a compromised update or XSS) to exfiltrate seed.  
- SignedTX_Tampering: Interceptor modifies the signed transaction payload before it’s sent to the node.  
- Backup_File_Tampering: An attacker alters seed‑phrase backup files, leading to loss or redirection of funds upon recovery.  

Repudiation:
- Missing_TX_Audit_Logs: No reliable proof that a user initiated or approved a given transaction.  
- Unlogged_2FA_Events: Lack of tamper‑evident logs for 2FA actions prevents proving or disproving authorization.  
- Seed_Access_Nonrepudiation: No audit trail of when or how the seed phrase was exported or accessed from the seed manager.  

Information Disclosure:
- Seed_In_Memory_Leak: Seed or private keys reside in memory and could be extracted by malware or memory‑dump tools.  
- Unencrypted_Backups: Users store backups unencrypted, exposing seed phrases if the storage medium is compromised.  
- UI_XSS: Cross‑site scripting in the web UI leaks sensitive data (seeds, balances) to attackers.  
- Network_Sniffing: Traffic between backend and public node not properly authenticated or encrypted, allowing eavesdropping.  

Denial of Service:
- Node_DOS_Via_Slowloris: Attacker floods the wallet’s node interface with slow requests, preventing TX broadcasts.  
- LocalStorage_Fill: Malicious or buggy process fills disk/storage quota, preventing new TX history writes or wallet startup.  
- UI_Render_DOS: Excessive or malformed transaction history loading causes the UI to hang or crash.  

Elevation of Privilege:
- Backend_Code_Injection: Exploitation of a vulnerability in backend logic to execute arbitrary code with user’s OS privileges.  
- 2FA_Bypass_Elevation: Flawed 2FA implementation lets an attacker elevate privileges by skipping second factor.  
- RPC_Admin_Action: Attacker invokes internal RPC/API endpoints (e.g., seed export, fund transfer) without proper auth.

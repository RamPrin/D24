### STRIDE Analysis

#### Spoofing
1. **Impersonation of User**: An attacker could attempt to spoof the user's identity to access the Trinity Wallet.
2. **IOTA Node Spoofing**: A malicious node could impersonate a legitimate IOTA node to intercept communications.

#### Tampering
1. **Data Tampering in Transit**: Data flowing from the Trinity Wallet Backend to the IOTA Network could be intercepted and altered.
2. **Local Storage Manipulation**: An attacker with access to the local device could tamper with encrypted data at rest.

#### Repudiation
1. **Action Denial**: Without proper logging, a user could deny transactions or actions performed.

#### Information Disclosure
1. **Seed Phrase Exposure**: If encryption is bypassed, the seed phrase could be exposed.
2. **Transaction Data Leak**: Intercepted network traffic could reveal transaction data.

#### Denial of Service
1. **IOTA Network Overload**: Saturating the network could deny service to legitimate users.
2. **Local Device Resource Exhaustion**: An attacker could exploit resource-intensive operations on the local device to cause a slowdown or crash.

#### Elevation of Privilege
1. **Unauthorized Access to Local Storage**: An attacker gaining unauthorized access could elevate privileges by manipulating stored data.

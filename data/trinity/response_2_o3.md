Below is a consolidated list of 12 threats against the “Trinity Wallet” model, using STRIDE categories. Each threat is given a short title, a brief description, and DREAD ratings (D=Damage Potential, R=Reproducibility, E=Exploitability, A=Affected Users, Di=Discoverability; 0–10) plus a total score (sum of the five).

1. Spoofing  
 S1. IOTA‑Node Impersonation  
  • Description: Attacker runs a fake node that sends bogus confirmations or conceals double‑spends.  
  • DREAD: D=7, R=6, E=5, A=8, Di=7 → Score=33  

 S2. Fake 2FA Interface  
  • Description: Malware on the device spoofs the 2FA prompt, captures one‑time codes.  
  • DREAD: D=6, R=6, E=6, A=7, Di=6 → Score=31  

2. Tampering  
 T1. Transaction Payload Modification  
  • Description: Man‑in‑the‑middle alters unsigned/signed transaction between backend and node_client.  
  • DREAD: D=8, R=5, E=6, A=7, Di=5 → Score=31  

 T2. Seed‑Store Corruption  
  • Description: Attacker tampers with the encrypted seed store (e.g. flips bits) to induce predictable failures or leak keys.  
  • DREAD: D=9, R=4, E=4, A=4, Di=6 → Score=27  

3. Repudiation  
 R1. Missing Transaction Audit Logs  
  • Description: No secure logging allows user or attacker to deny having created or broadcast a transaction.  
  • DREAD: D=4, R=3, E=4, A=8, Di=3 → Score=22  

 R2. Unlogged 2FA Events  
  • Description: Lack of tamper‑evident records for 2FA approvals/denials leads to disputes.  
  • DREAD: D=5, R=4, E=4, A=7, Di=4 → Score=24  

4. Information Disclosure  
 I1. Seed Phrase Extraction  
  • Description: Side‑channel or memory‑dump extracts decrypted seed from tx_sign process.  
  • DREAD: D=10, R=7, E=6, A=9, Di=8 → Score=40  

 I2. History‑Store Leak  
  • Description: Attacker gains read access to transaction history store (encrypted but key/material may be compromised).  
  • DREAD: D=5, R=6, E=5, A=8, Di=7 → Score=31  

5. Denial of Service  
 D1. Node‑Client Resource Exhaustion  
  • Description: Flooding IOTA node or node_client thread to block broadcasts and confirmations.  
  • DREAD: D=6, R=8, E=7, A=8, Di=5 → Score=34  

 D2. 2FA Service Outage  
  • Description: Attacker prevents 2FA (e.g. network jam or local port block), locking out legitimate transactions.  
  • DREAD: D=7, R=7, E=7, A=8, Di=6 → Score=35  

6. Elevation of Privilege  
 E1. Backend Code Injection  
  • Description: Malicious input exploits a vulnerability in backend logic to execute arbitrary code.  
  • DREAD: D=9, R=5, E=6, A=5, Di=5 → Score=30  

 E2. UI-to-Backend Privilege Escalation  
  • Description: Flawed IPC between UI and backend allows unprivileged UI code to trigger high‑privileged operations (e.g., signing).  
  • DREAD: D=8, R=5, E=6, A=7, Di=6 → Score=32

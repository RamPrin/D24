Server Impersonation: Attacker presents a forged certificate to the client to impersonate the server.\n- Client Impersonation: Attacker masquerades as a legitimate client to gain unauthorized access to the server.\n- MITM Handshake Relay: Attacker positions between client and server, relaying and modifying handshake messages.\n\nTampering:\n- Cipher Suite Downgrade: Attacker removes strong cipher suites from ClientHello to force weaker encryption.\n- Handshake Message Modification: Attacker alters ServerHello or Certificate messages to break authentication.\n- Finished Message Tampering: Attacker modifies the Finished message hashes to disrupt handshake integrity.\n\nRepudiation:\n- Handshake Non\u2011Repudiation Absence: No reliable logging of handshake steps allows parties to deny having initiated a session.\n- Silent Certificate Acceptance: Client suppresses certificate errors without logging, enabling denial of acceptance of invalid certs.\n- Unlogged Renegotiation: Lack of audit trails for TLS renegotiation permits denial of unexpected or malicious renegotiation.\n\nInformation Disclosure:\n- Handshake Sniffing: Passive attacker captures handshake messages, learning protocol versions, cipher suites, and random nonces.\n- Certificate Chain Exposure: Intercepted Certificate flow reveals internal hostnames or infrastructure details.\n- Session Ticket Leakage: Attacker intercepts session resumption tickets, enabling later session hijacking.\n- Pre\u2011master Secret Exposure: Weak RSA padding or implementation bugs leak the pre\u2011master secret to eavesdroppers.\n\nDenial of Service:\n- Handshake Flood: Attacker sends a high volume of ClientHello messages to exhaust server CPU and memory.\n- Expensive Key Exchange DoS: Forcing many ECDHE/DH handshakes to deplete server computational resources.\n- Fragmentation Attack: Malformed or overly fragmented handshake messages consume excessive memory buffers.\n\nElevation of Privilege:\n- Protocol Downgrade (POODLE): Attacker forces fallback to SSLv3 to exploit known SSLv3 vulnerabilities.\n- NULL Cipher Injection: Attacker injects a null\u2011encryption cipher suite to disable confidentiality.\n- Weak Key Attack (Logjam): Forcing use of weak (e.g., 512\u2011bit) DH parameters to break key exchange and derive the master secret.\n- Deprecated Hash Algorithm Downgrade: Attacker enforces use of MD5/SHA\u20111 for Finished message, enabling collision attacks.\n", "model": "", "threats": "# Threats\n<!---\nSpoofing:\n- Server Impersonation: Attacker presents a forged
